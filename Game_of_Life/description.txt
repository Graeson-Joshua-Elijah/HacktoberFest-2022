This folder contains a program implementing a simple GUI version of Conway's Game of Life.
A cellular automaton devised by John Horton Conway, it is a zero-player game, that is, the evolution is determined only by the initial state, and no actual players are involved.
The simple rules give rise to multiple interesting patterns that may be seen here shorturl.at/agLV0
The main program to be run is contained in the file Game_GUI.py, and the board size has been preset to be 10x10.
